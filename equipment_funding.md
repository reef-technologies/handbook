# Equipment Funding Policy

The Fund was created to improve working conditions, whether that means upgrading equipment, enhancing workstations, or providing other essential resources. Its purpose is to support contractors who require equipment for their daily work within our company. The Fund must be used solely for the benefit of the employee and not for family members or any other individuals.

As an internal/core staff member, you can request the purchase of equipment you'll use for work, such as a laptop, headset, webcam, monitor, mouse, keyboard, desk, an office chair, etc., provided you agree to the General Rules and detailed conditions below.

## General Rules

1. Equipment purchases must be **reasonable, work-related, cost-effective**, and for the **exclusive use of the contractor**.
2. Requests can only be made **while your contract is active** (i.e., before giving notice or termination).
3. The fund is available **for team members only**; it is **not available for Evaluation Period candidates and External contractors**.
4. There is a **maximum purchase limit per employee** (see Workplace Upgrade Fund and Budget).
5. Approvals are **presumed**, but you must **contact the HR Manager** before purchasing any equipment to confirm and receive guidance on the ordering procedure.
6. Equipment orders must be **paid using company funds** (company card or bank transfer), and **invoices must be issued in the company's name**.
7. **All amounts mentioned in this procedure refer to NET amounts (excluding added VAT, if applicable)**.

## Workplace Upgrade Fund (WUF) and Budget

The total purchase price of all equipment that the company funds for your use should not exceed $3,000 (net) plus your total Workplace Upgrade Fund.

**To estimate your WUF**:

- Calculate **2% of your total net earnings** since you joined the company.
- For example, if your total net earnings over a given period are X, your WUF is 0.02 × X.
- Always **confirm the exact amount with the HR Manager**.

**Formula:**  
```
Total Purchase Price ≤ $3,000 + WUF
```

You can request additional equipment at any time, as long as the **total purchase price does not exceed the limit**.

If you need to buy more expensive equipment, or if your accumulated funds are not yet sufficient and the purchase would exceed the limit, **please contact the HR Manager** to discuss your situation individually.

## Remaining Value and Transfer of Ownership

At any time, you can purchase the equipment from the company by paying the **Remaining Value**, which is calculated as the **purchase price minus your accumulated WUF** up to that point.

**Formula:**  
```
Remaining Value = Total Purchase Price − WUF
```

If you leave the company, you **must** buy the equipment by paying the Remaining Value. The company will issue an **invoice** for this amount. You are responsible for any tax implications of acquiring the equipment according to your local tax laws.

If the remaining value reaches zero, the company will automatically transfer ownership of the equipment to you.

The hardware is never returned. In all cases, it remains with you. If the equipment contains sensitive company data, you're responsible for disposing of it securely.

## Former internal/core team members who are now external contributors

Former **internal/core team members** who are currently **external contributors** can request equipment up to their accumulated WUF.

All worked hours count towards WUF, regardless of internal/core team member vs. external contributor status at the time.

## Transition

If you are using any company equipment purchased under the **previous co-funding policy**, you may **opt to switch to this new policy instead**.

## How to use the Fund?

1. **Identify your equipment needs.** Contact the HR Manager to:
    - Confirm the equipment you want, or ask the assistant for help in selecting the best option.
    - Check your available budget and total accumulated **Workplace Upgrade Fund**, and estimate how long it will take to cover the cost of the equipment fully.
    - Get instructions for purchasing.
2. After confirmation, **place your order**:
    - **On your own** – use the company card to pay and ensure the invoice is issued in the company's name and forwarded to the accounting & HR Manager.
    - **With help** – if you don't have a company card, cannot pay by card (bank transfers only), or simply prefer not to order yourself - the assistant/HR Manager will handle the purchase, obtain the invoice, and arrange delivery to your specified address.
3. Record & Settlement
    - After the purchase, the HR Manager will record the invoice and the purchase amount on your account.
    - In the event of contract termination, all completed purchases will be reviewed. Any equipment cost not yet covered by your Workplace Upgrade Fund will be settled according to the remaining balance.

# Examples

## Example 1

You requested that the company purchase a laptop valued at **$1,000**.

So far, you have earned $30,000 and accumulated $600 (2%) through the **Workplace Upgrade Fund (WUF)**. The request has been approved, and the company paid **$1,000** to acquire the laptop on your behalf.

- You may now continue working on the new device and accumulate the remaining balance to eventually become its owner.
- If your contract is terminated at this point, you would be required to pay **$400** to obtain full ownership of the laptop.

## Example 2

You started working without any company equipment, choosing to use your own laptop. However, shortly after being hired, you requested **Purchase 1** — an additional monitor for **$300**. The purchase was within the allowed limit, so it was processed without any issues.

After two months, you earned **$8,500** and accumulated 2% **($170)** through the **Workplace Upgrade Fund (WUF).** Your contract remains active, and you continue to earn. In the next two months, you'll accumulate a similar amount, and ownership of the monitor will eventually transfer to you.

Before that happens, you need to make a **Purchase 2** — a laptop for **$2,800**, because your personal device is no longer suitable for work - it broke down. You may wonder: *Can I buy a new laptop even though I haven't yet "paid off" Purchase 1?*

**Yes**, as long as the purchase is within the allowed limit, and your contract with the company remains active, you will continue to accumulate WUF and eventually become the owner of the laptop.
