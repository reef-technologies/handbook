# What is this about?

When you join the company (after successfully completing evaluation period), we need to bring you up to our level, or maybe you need to bring us to your level.
;) We believe that the best way to make sure we're on the same page is to show you some videos and articles, so here they are.
Bill the time spent doing this to `RT / onboarding`.
Please put the title of the video or article into the work subject note.

You don't need to see all of it in one go.
You're free to adjust your pace to the speed of your initial transition into the project.
If the transition is quick (you do lots of coding on your first day), slow it down and watch some training material every day.
If the transition is slow due to questions, timezones, environment issues, and other blocking problems, then report those and watch some training material.
Each link is followed by rough estimate of how much time read/watch takes to help with planning minimum time required for consuming particular learning material.

You are expected to watch or read everything that matches your position within two weeks from starting the work with the company (after evaluation period is finished completely).

# Evaluation period candidates

This section is for the evaluation period candidates in the 2nd stage of the Evaluation period (after Evaluation tasks 1-3).

- <http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/> - why you should never, ever, ever use MongoDB.
  NOTE:
  read that until you are sure you will never use it.
  If you are still not convinced after reading it, read [this](https://blog.scrapinghub.com/2013/05/13/mongo-bad-for-scraped-data/), if you are still not convinced, try [this](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/comment-page-1/), if you want more recent info, try \[this]\(<https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/primary-node-in-replica-set-down-and-2-weeks-of-data-lost/110472/6> - TL;DR:
  in a cluster overwhelmed with writes during primary node failure most writes landed in a journal, but became inaccessible after failback and in practice lost because there is no way to retrieve it from there; June 2021, Mongo 4.0), and if you still are not entirely sure, you might want to know that their "atomic" property actually makes it so that if you have a collection with some objects, and you'll query to get 1000 objects based on some criteria during an update operation, you will sometimes get 999 back.
  And that is by design, they closed the bug as "won't fix".
  So if you ask mongodb for something, you have to check if it returned what you asked for, because if it didn't, then you need to retry and *if you are lucky* then eventually you'll get what you asked for.
  Not everyone likes to write code like that and most people want to have access to their data always, not just when it's their lucky day.
  And also [this](https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/04/bitcoin-banking-mongodb/).
