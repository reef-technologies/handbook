# Introduction

Welcome onboard. This document will help you prepare your development environment step-by-step.

All data related to company **must** be stored in the virtual machine in encrypted volume. This practice prevents potential data leaks, i.e. when your computer get stolen. There are a few exceptions, that you will read about them later.

# Time tracking

### Sign in to e-mail account

The first step you will take is to sign in to your new Google account at reef.pl. All information including credentials have been sent to your personal e-mail address.

### **Caution!**

First sign in you make is from the host computer, as it is necessary to install the time tracking application. This is the one and only situation when you logging in from your host machine. 


### Time tracking app

We appreciate transparency, so are using the application that takes regular screenshots during your work. Its installation is the first step in preparing your environment to work.

Please install it and then accept the invitation received on your email address.

The application can be downloaded from here: [Hubstaff Tracker](https://app.hubstaff.com/download)


# Configuring the environment

Once you have installed time tracking app, it's time to prepeare your environment.

## 1. Create an encrypted volume (host)	

Due to the variety of operating systems used by our team, we do not impose a specific solution. It depends on what software you use. For Linux systems it can be eg LUKS.

Due to the large space utilization of our projects, the minimum partition size is **50 GB** (recommended **100 GB**).

In case you have no preferences, we recommend using [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html). The step-by-step instruction for the installation process is located [here](docs/VeraCrypt.md).


## 2. Virtual machine (host)

As with encryption software, we do not have specific requirements for what kind of solution you will use. The only requirement is the license. Recommended by us is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

To maintain consistency across all virtual machines, we use the [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php) distribution. We would like you to also work on this system. This will help us save time in the future.

A step-by-step guide to creating a virtual machine can be found [here](docs/VirtualBox.md).


## 3. Installing the necessary packages (vm)

You will need the following packages to work:

```bash
$ sudo apt install \
	docker.io \
	docker-compose \
	git \
	python3-pip \
	python3-setuptools \
	python3-virtualenv \
	virtualenvwrapper
```

## 4. Initial configuration (bash, git, ssh)

### SSH
First, generate an SSH key. We use Ed25519 which is more secure than default RSA key. We provided simple script that will do it all work for you.

Just download it from this repository and run:

```bash
$ ./configure-keychain.sh
```

### Git

Copy the `.gitconfig` file included in this repository into your home directory:

```bash
$ cp .gitconfig ~/
```

Complete username and email:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "ImiÄ™ Nazwisko"
$ git config --global user.email imie.nazwisko@reef.pl
```

### Bash

Copy the .bashrc file into your home directory

```bash
$ cp .bashrc ~/
```

### Docker

Add your user to `docker` group:

```bash
$ sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
```

*Note: For ease of use, an alias ** dc ** for docker-compose is added to the .bashrc file. Instead of typing a full name, you can use the shortened version.*

Example:

```bash
$ dc up
```


# 5. Configure your Google Account and GitHub

Since having a properly configured virtual machine, any logon to company accounts is done through it.

## Enable 2-step authorization for your Google Account

To improve the security of our accounts, we require you to enable 2-step verification.

[Google's 2-step authorization setup](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification)

## Create an account on GitHub

Create a new account for GitHub. The suggested username is the first letter of the first name and the full last name, and the suffix `-reef`, eg. ` jkowalski-reef`.

2-step authorization should enabled aswell.

# 6. Instant messengers

We use Slack and Skype for business communications. You can also use them in your browser, but for convenience, they are installed on **the host computer**.

### Slack

In your company e-mail inbox is waiting for you message with the invitation to the team reeftechnologies.slack.com.


Channels:

- #random - All topics not directly related to work. If you read something interesting, don't hesitate to share with us.
- #announcements - Business arrangements.
- #internal - Everything else.

Do not forget to say hello to us on #random. :)

### Skype

For Skype you can use your private account. If you do not want to do this, create a new account in the same format as your GitHub account.

# 7. Rules

Here are some rules to follow:

- When a meeting starts, decide where to bill it.
- If you are a junior and you get stuck - ask for help. Really, really, really do.
- If there is time where you are working but you are not able to bill it, escalate it immediately. We are trying to avoid it.
- Do not use the company email for RSS, out of work stuff etc. This is to minimize distractions, which is pretty important for us.
- Use pomodoro, pair programming or other time organization method.
- If you are not a manager - you shall not give estimates or deadlines to the client. Tell the client to ask the question to a manager.

# 8. Tools

### Pomotodo timer

[Marinara: Pomodoro Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro-timer/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef)


### Secure delete

The "srm" tool which securely deletes data. We use it to wipe the repos (despite encryption).

```bash
apt-get install secure-delete
```

# Congratulations

You've done all the things you need to get started. Good luck!
