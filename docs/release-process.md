A couple of things worth remembering when releasing a major chunk of software:

 - a deeper integration with the person responsible for emails
 - tooling for emails (export to klaviyo or something)
 - pre-registration for the social media buzz thing, where you can sign up to be notified about release
 - a couple of weeks blocked off in the schedule just in case for adjusting stuff after release even after a good round of testing
 - if the product is all about performance then automate the performance tests early on
 - pre-production release with fixtures is a good idea
