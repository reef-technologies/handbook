# Secure work environment setup for developers

Developers (after 2nd stage of Evaluation period i.e. before working on our clients' code base) are required to set up a Secure Work Environment on their workstations.
As not to slow down 1st stage of Evaluation period, please refrain from setting it up before you get clear signal, that your next task will require you to work with private Client data.
This is both for additional security and improved focus.

To ensure a clear segregation between your professional and personal digital spaces, 
preventing accidental cross-access or data leaks involving customer data, 
your work environment must be set up in one of the following ways:

* using separate physical machine,
* dual boot,
* virtual machine.

In all cases, your disk must be fully encrypted as described [here](Storage_Encryption.md).

You may find a handy guide on how to set up your system [here](Developer_environment_setup.md).

If you have previously used your reef.pl email address (or any associated) on a personal environment, make sure to remove it from all devices and accounts.
Only exception being [secure mobile devices](security-rules.md#mobile-devices).

## What is allowed on the secure work environment

The goal of the secure work environment is to maintain clean separation between your personal data and the company
data. Thus, you should refrain from: 

* performing any personal tasks like shopping, using social media... 
* using personal keys, GitHub accounts etc. (we don't want them to mix up don't we?)

You may though use your personal accounts to use private IDE licences, login into music streaming platforms or use
other personal tools useful in your work.

Using your work environment for our team gaming sessions is permitted if the game does not require admin permissions to run.
